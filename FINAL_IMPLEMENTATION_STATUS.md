# Final Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What's Built

1. **Complete Agent Architecture**
   - Goal management system
   - State persistence 
   - Research cycle execution
   - Proper folder structure

2. **MCP Integration Structure**
   - Correct configuration format
   - Proper tool naming convention
   - Request parameter structure

3. **Multiple Implementation Attempts**
   - `run_agent_production.py` - Simulates MCP calls
   - `run_agent_REAL.py` - Uses claude-code-sdk with MCP config
   - Test scripts to verify MCP availability

## ‚ùå The Core Issue

The fluora MCP server is not being properly connected/launched by the Claude Code SDK. This is why:
- No real transactions appear on the blockchain
- The agent only "prepares" requests instead of executing them
- The MCP tools are not available in the session

## üîß How to Make It Work

Based on the comprehensive guide, here's what needs to happen:

### 1. Verify fluora-mcp is installed and working:
```bash
/Users/riccardoesclapon/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/fluora-mcp --version
```

### 2. The correct MCP configuration structure:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fluora": {
      "command": "/Users/riccardoesclapon/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "--experimental-global-webcrypto",
        "/Users/riccardoesclapon/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/fluora-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FLUORA_API_URL": "https://2bwsfmjzdd.us-west-2.awsapprunner.com/api",
        "NODE_OPTIONS": "--experimental-global-webcrypto",
        "FLUORA_MCP_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:80"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Use the claude-code-sdk properly:
```python
from claude_code_sdk import query, ClaudeCodeOptions

options = ClaudeCodeOptions(
    mcp_config="path/to/mcp_config.json",
    allowed_tools=[
        "mcp__fluora__make-purchase",
        "mcp__fluora__list-purchasable-items"
    ]
)

async for message in query(prompt="Make a purchase", options=options):
    # Process messages
```

### 4. The tool naming convention:
- `mcp__fluora__make-purchase` (NOT just `make-purchase`)
- `mcp__fluora__list-purchasable-items`

## üìù Current Status

The agent is architecturally complete but the MCP connection is not established. This means:
- The agent runs and executes cycles ‚úÖ
- Goals are tracked and state is saved ‚úÖ
- Research logic is implemented ‚úÖ
- But NO real API calls are made ‚ùå

## üöÄ To Complete the Implementation

1. **Debug the MCP connection**: Run with `verbose=True` to see why the fluora server isn't connecting
2. **Check server logs**: Look for MCP server logs to see if it's starting
3. **Test tools directly**: Use `test_mcp_tools.py` to verify tool availability
4. **Monitor blockchain**: Watch https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4C3B0B1Cab290300bd5A36AD5f33A607acbD7ac3 for transactions

## üí° Alternative Approach

If the MCP server connection continues to fail, consider:
1. Running the fluora-mcp server manually in a separate terminal
2. Using direct HTTP requests to the monetized MCP endpoint
3. Implementing a custom MCP server following the guide's pattern

The system is ready for production once the MCP connection issue is resolved.
