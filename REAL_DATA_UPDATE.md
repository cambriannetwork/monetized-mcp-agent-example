# üö® REAL DATA ENFORCEMENT UPDATE

## Changes Made

### 1. DELETED All Simulated Data Generation
- ‚ùå Removed `_generate_realistic_price_data()` function completely
- ‚ùå Deleted the fake `price_cache.json` with simulated data
- ‚úÖ Now throws errors if insufficient real data

### 2. Created Real MCP Data Collector
- ‚úÖ New `RealMCPDataCollector` class that ONLY accepts real MCP data
- ‚úÖ Tracks source of each price point
- ‚úÖ Stores data in `knowledge/real_mcp_data/real_prices.json`

### 3. Updated Data Collection
- `collect_price_history()` now REQUIRES real data or throws error
- No fallback to simulated data - it will fail if not enough real data
- Multi-token collection now throws NotImplementedError for non-SOL tokens

### 4. Integration with Agent
- Agent now saves real MCP prices when purchases are made
- Price data is marked with source "MCP_Purchase"
- Real data collector is initialized with the agent

## What Happens Now

When the agent runs:
1. If insufficient real data ‚Üí Strategy research will FAIL with clear error
2. Agent MUST make more MCP purchases to collect real price data
3. Only after enough real data is collected can strategies be developed
4. ALL backtesting will use REAL market data only

## Next Steps

The agent needs to:
1. Make multiple MCP purchases to build up real price history
2. Collect at least 100 real data points before strategy development
3. Use ONLY this real data for all analysis

## NO MORE FAKE DATA! üéØ
