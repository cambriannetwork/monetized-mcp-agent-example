# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: MCP Integration Status

## Current Situation

The agent is built and working, but it's currently **NOT making real MCP calls**. Here's why:

### What's Working:
1. ✅ Agent architecture and cycle execution
2. ✅ Goal management and research logic
3. ✅ State persistence
4. ✅ Research finding storage
5. ✅ MCP request preparation with correct parameters

### What's NOT Working:
1. ❌ Actual MCP server connection
2. ❌ Real paid transactions
3. ❌ Live Cambrian API data retrieval

## The Issue

The current implementation is preparing MCP requests but not executing them because:

1. The `fluora` MCP server configured in `config/mcp_config.json` is not properly connected to Claude
2. The MCP tools (`mcp__fluora__make-purchase`) are not available in the current Claude session
3. The agent is simulating the requests instead of making real calls

## Evidence

- No transactions appear at: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4C3B0B1Cab290300bd5A36AD5f33A607acbD7ac3
- `ListMcpResourcesTool` returns empty array
- The "Request prepared" messages are just preparing data, not sending it

## How to Fix

To make REAL MCP calls, you need to:

1. **Ensure the fluora MCP server is running:**
   ```bash
   # Check if it's installed
   which fluora-mcp
   
   # Start it manually if needed
   /Users/riccardoesclapon/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/node \
     --experimental-global-webcrypto \
     /Users/riccardoesclapon/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin/fluora-mcp
   ```

2. **Connect it to Claude properly:**
   - The MCP server must be running and accessible
   - Claude must have the MCP tools available (`mcp__fluora__make-purchase`)
   - The configuration in `config/mcp_config.json` must match the running server

3. **Use the provided example format:**
   ```json
   {
     "args": {
       "itemId": "solanapricecurrent",
       "params": {
         "token_address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
       },
       "itemPrice": 0.001,
       "paymentMethod": "USDC_BASE_SEPOLIA",
       "serverWalletAddress": "0x4C3B0B1Cab290300bd5A36AD5f33A607acbD7ac3"
     },
     "serverId": "9f2e4fe1-dc04-4ed1-bab4-0f374cb9f8a7",
     "toolName": "make-purchase",
     "mcpServerUrl": "https://mcp.rickycambrian.org/monetized"
   }
   ```

## Current Implementation

The agent currently:
- Prepares the correct MCP request structure
- Shows what it WOULD do if MCP was connected
- Saves placeholder data instead of real API responses

## Next Steps

1. Debug why the fluora MCP server isn't available to Claude
2. Ensure the MCP server is properly started and configured
3. Test with the `test_real_mcp.py` script once MCP is available
4. Monitor https://sepolia.basescan.org for actual transactions

Until the MCP connection is fixed, the agent will continue to run in "simulation mode" - doing everything except the actual paid API calls.
