# MCP-Based Data Science Architecture

## Overview

This system implements a unified data science workflow using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling both interactive exploration and automated model training through a single data gateway.

## Key Components

### 1. Query Tracker (`src/persistence/query_tracker.py`)
- Tracks successful MCP queries and their patterns
- Stores query sequences that work for specific goal types
- Provides pattern recommendations for future queries
- Maintains a cache of successful query parameters

### 2. Python MCP Client (`src/mcp_client/python_client.py`)
- Programmatic client for Python scripts to access MCP servers
- Caching mechanism for efficient repeated queries
- Specialized methods for common operations (e.g., `get_solana_price()`)
- Batch operations support

### 3. Model Training Script (`train_model.py`)
- Demonstrates using MCP data for ML model training
- Includes a `SolanaPricePredictor` class that:
  - Fetches real-time data via MCP
  - Trains price prediction models
  - Saves models with versioning
- `ModelScheduler` class for automated retraining

## Architecture Benefits

### Client-Agnostic Design
The same MCP server serves:
- **Interactive Clients**: VS Code, Claude Desktop for exploration
- **Programmatic Clients**: Python scripts for automation

### Centralized Data Access
- All data logic in one place (MCP server)
- Consistent data transformations
- Single point for security and governance
- Easy to maintain and update

### Production-Ready Features
1. **Query Tracking**: Learn from successful patterns
2. **Caching**: Reduce redundant API calls
3. **Scheduling**: Automated model retraining
4. **Versioning**: Track models and data over time

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Exploration
```python
# In VS Code or Claude Desktop chat:
"Show me the current SOL price and analyze trends"
```

### Programmatic Access
```python
from src.mcp_client import PythonMCPClient

client = PythonMCPClient()
price = await client.get_solana_price()
```

### Model Training
```bash
# Train a new model
python train_model.py
# Choose option 1

# Run continuous scheduler
python train_model.py
# Choose option 3
```

## Data Flow

1. **Agent makes MCP query** → Query Tracker records success
2. **Query Tracker identifies patterns** → Agent uses patterns in prompts
3. **Python scripts use same MCP tools** → Consistent data access
4. **Models trained on MCP data** → Production-ready ML pipeline

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Scheduling**: Cron-like job scheduling
2. **Model Registry**: Track and version all trained models
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare different model architectures
4. **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket support for live data
5. **Distributed Training**: Scale across multiple workers

## Security Considerations

- MCP server acts as security gateway
- Credentials never exposed to clients
- All queries logged and auditable
- Rate limiting built into client

This architecture transforms the MCP server from a simple connector into a strategic data access layer for the entire ML lifecycle.
