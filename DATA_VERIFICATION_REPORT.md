# Data Verification Report: Cambrian Trading Agent

## Summary
**The agent is currently using SIMULATED data, NOT real MCP data.**

## Evidence

### 1. Data Source Analysis
Looking at `src/strategy/mcp_data_collector.py`:
- The `collect_price_history()` method checks for cached data first
- If insufficient cached data exists, it calls `_generate_realistic_price_data()`
- This method generates synthetic price data using a random walk algorithm
- Comments throughout indicate "In production, this would make MCP calls"

### 2. Price Data Characteristics
The `price_cache.json` shows:
- Prices range from $155.41 to $179.99 with consistent hourly timestamps
- The data follows a random walk pattern with mean reversion
- All timestamps are exactly 1 hour apart (unrealistic for real market data)
- The volatility and price movements match the parameters in `_generate_realistic_price_data()`

### 3. Backtesting Results
The strategy results are suspiciously consistent across multiple cycles:
- Exact same win rates, profit factors, and returns every time
- The "Momentum Reversal" strategy always shows exactly 9.72474896633199% profit
- This indicates the same static dataset is being used repeatedly

### 4. MCP Integration Status
While the agent DOES make real MCP purchases (as shown by "üí≥ Making purchase" logs), it appears to be:
- Making the purchase but not using the returned data
- Falling back to simulated data for strategy development
- The purchased data may not be properly integrated into the analysis pipeline

## Conclusion
The agent is a hybrid system that:
1. ‚úÖ Makes REAL MCP purchases (costing 0.001 USDC each)
2. ‚ùå Does NOT use the real data for strategy development
3. ‚ùå Uses SIMULATED data for all backtesting and analysis

## Recommendation
To use real data, the system needs to:
1. Properly parse and store the MCP response data
2. Update the `collect_price_history()` method to use MCP data instead of simulated data
3. Implement proper data persistence for MCP-sourced prices
4. Remove or disable the `_generate_realistic_price_data()` fallback for production use
