# Cambrian Trading Agent - Error Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied

### 1. JSON Serialization Error with Numpy Types
**Problem**: The agent was crashing with `TypeError: Object of type bool_ is not JSON serializable` when saving strategy results.

**Root Cause**: The backtesting and strategy evaluation functions were returning numpy types (np.bool_, np.float64) which cannot be directly serialized to JSON.

**Solution**:
- Updated `evaluate_strategy_profitability()` in `backtester.py` to convert numpy bool_ to Python bool
- Added `_convert_numpy_types()` method to `StrategyDeveloper` and `StrategyResearchEngine` classes
- Modified save methods to convert all numpy types recursively before JSON serialization

**Files Modified**:
- `src/strategy/backtester.py`
- `src/strategy/strategy_developer.py`
- `src/agent/strategy_research.py`

### 2. RuntimeError Spam Suppression
**Problem**: The agent was outputting repetitive RuntimeError messages: "Attempted to exit cancel scope in a different task"

**Root Cause**: The anyio library was generating these warnings when cancelling async operations, but they were harmless and cluttering the output.

**Solution**:
- Added warning filters to suppress specific RuntimeError messages about cancel scope
- Wrapped all `claude_query()` async iterations with proper error handling
- Added logging level configuration to reduce anyio verbosity

**Files Modified**:
- `cambrian_agent.py` (multiple methods)

### 3. Undefined 'query' Reference
**Problem**: The `research_arbitrage_opportunities()` method was using undefined `query` instead of `claude_query`.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed all occurrences to use `claude_query` consistently

## Additional Cleanup
- Removed corrupted `strategy_history.json` file that was causing JSON decode errors

## Testing
Created `test_numpy_conversion.py` to verify the numpy type conversion is working correctly. All numpy types are now properly converted to Python native types before JSON serialization.

## Result
The agent should now run without:
- JSON serialization errors when saving strategy results
- RuntimeError spam in the console output
- Undefined reference errors

These fixes make the agent more stable and the output cleaner for production use.
