# ðŸ“Š Efficient Real Data Collection Guide

## Current Status
- You have ~8 real price points
- Need 100 points for strategy development
- Each point costs 0.001 USDC

## Methods to Collect Data More Effectively

### 1. ðŸš€ Use the Data Collection Script (FASTEST)
```bash
python collect_real_data.py
```
This script will:
- Run intensive batch collection
- Collect ~20 prices per batch
- Complete 100 points in ~5 batches
- Total time: ~10-15 minutes
- Total cost: ~$0.10 USDC

### 2. ðŸ”„ Let Agent Run in Data Collection Mode
The agent now automatically enters "Data Collection Mode" when it has < 100 points:
- Shorter 5-second cycles (instead of 15)
- Focused only on price collection
- More efficient prompts
- Should collect 100 points in ~30-40 cycles

### 3. ðŸ“ˆ Look for Bulk Data Products
Some MCP servers offer:
- Historical price data (multiple points in one purchase)
- 24-hour price charts
- Trading statistics with price history

Check if Cambrian offers these by exploring:
```
- "24h price history"
- "price chart data"
- "historical prices"
```

### 4. ðŸŽ¯ Optimize Current Collection
To make the current agent more efficient:
- The agent now extracts prices more aggressively
- Multiple price extraction patterns
- Saves every valid price found
- Reduces wasted purchases

## Recommendations

### For Fastest Results:
1. Run `python collect_real_data.py` 
2. Let it collect 92 more points (~$0.092 USDC)
3. Then resume normal agent operation

### For Cheapest Results:
1. Look for bulk historical data products first
2. A single "24h history" purchase might give 24+ data points

### For Automated Results:
1. Just let the agent run
2. It will automatically collect data until it has 100 points
3. Then switch to strategy development

## Cost Breakdown
- Current: 8 points collected
- Needed: 92 more points
- Cost: 92 Ã— $0.001 = $0.092 USDC
- Time: ~10-15 minutes with collection script

## Why 100 Points?
- Minimum for reliable backtesting
- Covers different market conditions
- Allows for proper train/test split
- Enables meaningful technical indicators

Once you have 100 real data points, the agent will automatically start developing and backtesting REAL trading strategies!
