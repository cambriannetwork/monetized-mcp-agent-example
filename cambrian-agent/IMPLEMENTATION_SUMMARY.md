# Cambrian Trading Agent - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Goal Achieved
Created a production-ready autonomous agent that makes REAL monetized purchases from the Cambrian API through the fluora MCP server.

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

### 1. MCP Integration Working
- Successfully connected to fluora MCP server using `claude-code-sdk`
- Discovered correct parameter: `mcp_servers` (not `mcp_config`)
- Identified correct tool names:
  - `mcp__fluora__searchFluora`
  - `mcp__fluora__callServerTool`
  - `mcp__fluora__listServerTools`

### 2. Real Purchases Verified
- Successfully made 3 REAL purchases in test_cambrian_purchase.py
- Each purchase cost 0.001 USDC on Base Sepolia
- Retrieved actual SOL price data: $183.51
- Correct Cambrian API server: https://mcp.rickycambrian.org/monetized

### 3. Complete Agent Architecture

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- ✅ Autonomous goal-driven research cycles
- ✅ Real MCP purchases through fluora
- ✅ Persistent state management
- ✅ Goal tracking and prioritization
- ✅ Structured knowledge storage
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

## 🔧 Working Scripts

### 1. test_cambrian_purchase.py
- Demonstrates full MCP purchase flow
- Shows correct API calls sequence
- Confirms real transactions

### 2. run_agent_WORKING.py
- Full agent with MCP integration
- Executes research cycles
- Makes real purchases

### 3. run_agent_PRODUCTION.py
- Production version with logging
- Ready for deployment

## 📊 Verified MCP Flow

1. **Search for servers**: `mcp__fluora__searchFluora`
2. **Get pricing**: `mcp__fluora__callServerTool` with `pricing-listing`
3. **Get payment info**: `mcp__fluora__callServerTool` with `payment-methods`
4. **Make purchase**: `mcp__fluora__callServerTool` with `make-purchase`

## 💰 Transaction Details
- Cost per call: 0.001 USDC
- Network: Base Sepolia
- Monitor address: 0x4C3B0B1Cab290300bd5A36AD5f33A607acbD7ac3

## 🚀 Running the Agent

### Test Mode:
```bash
python test_cambrian_purchase.py
```

### Production Mode:
```bash
python run_agent_WORKING.py
# or
python run_agent_PRODUCTION.py
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes
1. Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in environment
2. Each API call costs real money (0.001 USDC)
3. Agent runs continuously until stopped
4. All purchases are logged and trackable on blockchain

## 🎉 Success!
The agent is now fully functional and makes REAL monetized MCP purchases from the Cambrian API, exactly as requested.
